TODO
- Update assembly info.
- Double check LICENSE, README, etc
- Namespace cleanup



Notes
- Need to double-check out-of-order items (i.e., if an item can come before its parent directory).
Need to check assumptions about item order.
- Items list - get by index vs get by id.





Design decisions
- Trying to limit the amount of mutability. For example, items are limited in the amount of data that can change after the object is constructed.
	- The writer returns a new list of items and a new archive object.
	- Allows handling cases where there is an error in writing. In that case the data is not left in a partial state and the application can recover.
- Library waits to apply changes to an items list until the archive is written.
	- Replacement files aren't compressed until the writer begins to write.
- The application (NEfsEdit) works with a command buffer approach to allow undo/redo. Also tracks archive modified state.
	- Should utilize this interface (via workspace) instead of modifying items directly.
