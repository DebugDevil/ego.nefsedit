TODO
- Update assembly info.
- Double check LICENSE, README, etc
- Namespace cleanup



Notes
- Need to double-check out-of-order items (i.e., if an item can come before its parent directory).
I think nefslib can handle if they are not in order. I don't know if the game expects that or not.
My guess would be it does. So probably want nefslib to write out items to meet that assumption?
