# NeFS Edit

NeFS Edit allows opening and modifying NeFS archive files. These archive files are used by Ego Engine games such as DiRT 4 and DiRT Rally 2.

There are two components to this project.
- NefsLib - a C# library for working with NeFS archives.
- NefsEdit - a Windows Forms application that uses NefsLib.
